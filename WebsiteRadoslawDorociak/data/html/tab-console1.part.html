	<h4>Pros:</h4>
	<h5>Backwards Compatibility</h5>
	One of the great features of the PS5 is that you can launch your older PS4 games on it without a problem. Of course that is only possible with Standard edition.
	Get ready to replay some of the games with improved performance all with no extra cost.
	<h5>Used Games</h5>
	What might just be the best part about a disc drive, is that no game is ever permamently bound to your account. That means that once you're done playing the game, you can simply re-sell it
	and regain some of your money. Better yet, you can buy it used in the first place and save right from the get go.
	<h5>Blu ray</h5>
	Say goodbye to buying hardware specifically to enjoy movies, because this console will do the trick. Enjoy high quality movies thanks to build in drive.
	<h4>Cons:</h4>
	<h5>Price</h5>
	The only real con that can be attributed to the Standard edition is the higher initial price. It is listed at £449.99, when Digital would cost you only £359.99.
	However, in my personal opinion this flaw is outset by the long-term saving possible with methods listed above.
