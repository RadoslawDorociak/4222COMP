	<h4>Pros:</h4>
	<h5>Price</h5>
	Compared to the Standard version, Digital is more affordable. It is listed at £359.99, when Standard would cost you a whole £449.99. It amounts to a nearly £100 difference.
	<h5>Appearance</h5>
	While it may seem petty to even mention such a trivial thing, Digital edition has a more consistent design and is slightly smaller.
	<h4>Cons:</h4>
	<h5>Less choice</h5>
	With this edition, you are limited to digital games. That means you don't get to buy used physical copies or resell them later on. 
	With that in mind, the initial cost difference might prove insignificant when you consider the long term saving possible with the Standard Edition.
	<h5>No backwards compatibility</h5>
	One of the great features of the PS5 is that you can launch your older PS4 games on it without a problem. Of course that is only possible with Standard edition.
	If you purchase the digital version, get ready to build your digital library from the start, and pay full price for each game.
	<h5>No blu-ray compatibility</h5>
	Another feature that this version end up missing out on is the ability to play movies from blu ray discs, as there is no disc drive.
